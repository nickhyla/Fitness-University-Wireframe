        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>
          The home page is all about attention. The usage of color and high contrast keeps the user engaged as they
          scroll down the page. The newsletter section is bright and colorful to make the section more inviting, leading
          to a higher click-through rate.

        <h2>Store Page</h2>
        <p>
          The store page was created to be a generic card system, that could be used for both the Equipment and
          Supplement stores. With this type of system, it would be easy to add or remove new product sections.

        <h2>Workouts Page</h2>
        <p>
          The workouts page is designed to deliver as much information to the user as possible, without sacrificing too
          much whitespace. It does this by having both text and video for each workout, and limiting the text area to
          the thumbnail height.
